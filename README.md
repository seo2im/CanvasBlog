# CANVAS BLOG

This project makes blog for canvas animation browser.

## New Check Point
### dev-sever
`webpack-dev-server` command is changed to `webpack server` over 5.x webpack.

### setInterval in useEffect

`useEffect` called everytime states are changed (or setting states are changed)

### Use Effect split (-> PointShot check)

Draw and anim must be splited. it same time, work hardly draw (like cluple)

###  Canvas vs Css clipping
css clipping is better to styling...
canvas use in animation is better
